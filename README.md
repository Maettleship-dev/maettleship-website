# Maettleship

Maettleship is a simple online battleship game that I design for maÃ« (my grilfriend) when lectures are boring. 
It's made entirely in javascript using nodejs for the server part with socketio and express module. I also use mysql for all my database part. Finally, I use docker and a vps that I pay for online deployment

# Requirement

To use maettleship you'll need the following app on your computer

* node js and npm
* mysql
* docker

# Installation

### Online

You can reach maettleship here : https://maettleship.com
Even if I've improve security a lot recently I encourage you to not use your real password we never know when a new attack I didn't handle will come.

### Locally

Follow those first steps to get started if tou want to run maettleship locally

```
git clone https://github.com/viastolfi/maettleship.git
cd maettleship
npm install
```

Now, you have the repo with all the dependency. After that, you'll have to create the database that is used for the account creation and usage.

```
chmod +x ./tools/db_docker_init.sh
./tools/db_docker_init.sh
```

I choose to use container for mysql to avoid bugs that can happened when working on other computers that my main one. It could also fix bug you could face so it's better overall.

Finally, you need a `.env`file with your personnal mysql information so follow those steps. You also need this file to specify your cookie's private key so you can create them

```
touch .env
```

The .env file should look like that

```
echo "ACTUAL_ENV=dev
DB_USER=root
DB_PASSWORD=password
DB_NAME=battleship
DB_HOST=localhost
COOKIE_SECRET_KEY=secret_key" > .env
```

You can use the env file as it is in my example but if you want make it yours just don't forget to have the same variable in your env file that in you mysql config.

The `ACTUAL_ENV` variable aim to make the switch between dev and prod environment easier. You won't have to change it if you want to run maettleship localy.

Now you can start the server using the following command on your terminal.

`npm run dev`
