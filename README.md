# Maettleship

Maettleship is a simple online battleship game that I design for maÃ« (my grilfriend) when lectures are boring. 
It's made entirely in javascript using nodejs for the server part with socketio and express module.

# Requirement

To use maettleship you'll need the following app on your computer

* node js and npm
* mysql

# Installation

Later, maettleship will be usable online but you can test it localy now if you want !

Follow those first steps to get started

```
git clone https://github.com/viastolfi/maettleship.git
npm install
```

Now, you have the repo with all the dependency. After that, you'll have to create the database that is used for the account creation and usage.

```
mysql -u user -p
> mysql source db_script.sql
```

Finally, you need a `.env`file with your personnal mysql information so follow those steps.

```
touch .env
```

The .env file should look like thah

```
DB_USER=userName
DB_PASSWORD=UserPassword
DB_NAME=maettleship
DB_HOST=localhost
```

Now you can start the server using the following command on your terminal.

`npm run start`
